-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *most* sophisticated background **location-tracking & geofencing** module with battery-conscious motion-detection intelligence for **iOS** and **Android**.

The plugin's [Philosophy of Operation](../../wiki/Philosophy-of-Operation) is to use **motion-detection** APIs (using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) to detect when the device is *moving* and *stationary*.

- When the device is detected to be **moving**, the plugin will *automatically* start recording a location according to the configured `distanceFilter` (meters).

- When the device is detected be **stationary**, the plugin will automatically turn off location-services to conserve energy.

Also available for [React Native](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation), [NativeScript](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt) and pure native apps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **[Android plugin](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation)** requires [purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).  However, it *will* work for **DEBUG** builds.  It will **not** work with **RELEASE** builds [without purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).

(2018) This plugin is supported **full-time** and field-tested **daily** since 2013.

## :large_blue_diamond: Installing the plugin ##

:warning: After installing the plugin, you must [Configure the Plugin](#large_blue_diamond-configuring-the-plugin) for both [iOS](#ios) &amp; [Android](#android).

- #### From npm

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt
```

- #### Ionic

```bash
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt
```

- #### Capacitor

```bash
npm install cordova-background-geolocation-lt
npx cap sync
```
:information_source: See [Capacitor Setup](./help/INSTALL_CAPACITOR.md)


- #### Phonegap Build

```xml
  <plugin name="cordova-background-geolocation-lt" source="npm">

  </plugin>
```

#### From master (latest, greatest.)

```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt.git
```

## :large_blue_diamond: Configuring the plugin

### Android

- Open `config.xml`:  Add the following *namespace* attribute to the top-level `<widget>` element:

```diff
<widget
  id="com.foo.bar"
  version="1.0.0"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
+ xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:cdv="http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0">
```

- Within the `<platform name="android">` container, add the `license_key` key using a `<config-file />` element:
- :information_source: If you haven't yet [purchased a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation), you can skip this step &mdash; the plugin is **fully functional in *DEBUG* builds without a license** so you can *try before you buy*.  You will see a Toast message "*License Validation Failure*" when your app boots &mdash; **ignore it**.

```xml
<platform name="android">
      <!-- background-geolocation -->
      <config-file parent="/manifest/application" target="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml">
          <meta-data
            android:name="com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.license_key"
            android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE" />
      </config-file>
      <!-- /background-geolocation -->
</platform>
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:warning: On older version of Cordova, If you **change your license key** after building android, you might receive an error:
```diff
BUILD FAILED in 1s

-Element meta-data#com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.license at AndroidManifest.xml duplicated
-with element declared at AndroidManifest.xml duplicated with element declared at AndroidManifest.xml
```

Simply remove and re-add the android platform:

```
$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Android Gradle Dependency Configuration.

Quite often, other 3rd-party plugins will require the same dependencies used by background-geolocation, including:
- `play-services:location`
- `com.android.support` libraries
- `okhttp` (Android HTTP library)

If your app requests different versions of these dependencies, it can cause a build-failure (See wiki [Solving Build Failures](./wiki/Solving-Build-Failures)).  Background Geolocation exposes the following **Android** CLI configuration `--variable` to help you align the required dependency versions with other plugins:

Cordova CLI `--variable` are used as follows:

:exclamation: To apply changes to these `--variable`, you **must** remove/re-add the cordova platform(s)

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable FOO=value_foo --variable BAR=value_bar

// After adding --variable, remove and re-add the platform
$ cordova platform remove android
$ cordova platform add android
```

##### `@variable GOOGLE_API_VERSION ["16.+"]`
Sets the desired version of `play-services-location` dependency.  Many other plugins require `play-services` dependencies, (eg: `cordova-plugin-googlemaps`, `phonegap-plugin-push`):  If the version of `play-services` and/or `firebase` is not aligned to the **same** version for **ALL** plugins, your build **will fail**.

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable GOOGLE_API_VERSION=16.0.0
```

##### `@variable APPCOMPAT_VERSION ["27.+"]`
Sets the desired version of `com.google.android.appcompat-v7` dependency.  Many other plugins can require a different version of `appcompat-v7` dependeny:  If the version of `appcompat-v7` is not aligned to the **same** version for **ALL** plugins, your build **will fail**.  `BackgroundGeolocation` requires a minimum version of `26.1.0` due to its support for Android 8.

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable APPCOMPAT_VERSION=27.+
```

##### `@variable OKHTTP_VERSION ["3.12.+"]`
Sets the desired version of `okhttp` to import.  The Android plugin uses [okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for its HTTP service.  Some other plugins can also import `okhttp` (eg: `cordova-plugin-advanced-http`).  If both plugins don't align themselves to the same version, your Android build will fail.

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable OKHTTP_VERSION=3.12.+
```

### iOS

iOS requires a number of "Usage Strings" for location and motion-usage authorization.  iOS will render these strings upon the dialog used to request permission from the user.  Take care to write relevent descriptions of *why* your app requires these authorizations as they can affect whether Apple accepts your app or not.

Paste **all** the following elements into the `<platform name="ios">` container:

```xml
<platform name="ios">
    <!-- background-geolocation -->
    <config-file parent="NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
        <string>[CHANGEME] Background location tracking is required for our app so we can...</string>
    </config-file>
    <config-file parent="NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
        <string>[CHANGEME pre-iOS11.  No longer used with iOS 12] Background location tracking is required for our app so we can...</string>
    </config-file>
    <config-file parent="NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
        <string>[CHANGEME] Background location tracking is required for our app so we can...</string>
    </config-file>
    <config-file parent="NSMotionUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
        <string>[CHANGEME] Device motion updates help determine when the device is stationary so the app can save power by turning off location-updates</string>
    </config-file>
    <!-- /background-geolocation -->
</platform>
```

#### Configuring for `useSignificantChangesOnly`

For those using `useSignificantChangesOnly: true`, possibly because Apple *denied* your use of the background `location` capability, you can disable background `location` by providing the `BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION` `--variable` with an empty-string:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt --variable BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION=""

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios
```

## :large_blue_diamond: Using the Plugin

There are **three** simple steps to using `BackgroundGeolocation`:

1. [Listen to events](https://transistorsoft.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/classes/_cordova_background_geolocation_lt_.backgroundgeolocation.html).
2. [`#ready`](https://transistorsoft.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/classes/_cordova_background_geolocation_lt_.backgroundgeolocation.html#ready) the plugin.
3. [`#start`](https://transistorsoft.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/classes/_cordova_background_geolocation_lt_.backgroundgeolocation.html#start) the plugin.

### Ionic 2+ with Typescript

The plugin hosts its own Typescript API:

[Sample Implementation](https://gist.github.com/christocracy/0379dd519d77f4215d5de943ed51ade9)

```typescript
// You may import any optional interfaces
import BackgroundGeolocation, {
  State,
  Config,
  Location,
  LocationError,
  Geofence,
  HttpEvent,
  MotionActivityEvent,
  ProviderChangeEvent,
  MotionChangeEvent,
  GeofenceEvent,
  GeofencesChangeEvent,
  HeartbeatEvent,
  ConnectivityChangeEvent
} from "cordova-background-geolocation-lt";

class HomeView {
  .
  .
  .
  // Like any Cordova plugin, you must wait for Platform.ready() before referencing the plugin.
  configureBackgroundGeolocation() {
    // 1.  Listen to events.
    BackgroundGeolocation.onLocation(location => {
      console.log('[location] - ', location);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.onMotionChange(event => {
      console.log('[motionchange] - ', event.isMoving, event.location);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.onHttp(response => {
      console.log('[http] - ', response.success, response.status, response.responseText);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.onProviderChange(event => {
      console.log('[providerchange] - ', event.enabled, event.status, event.gps);
    });

    // 2.  Configure the plugin with #ready
    BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
      reset: true,
      debug: true,
      logLevel: BackgroundGeolocation.LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE,
      desiredAccuracy: BackgroundGeolocation.DESIRED_ACCURACY_HIGH,
      distanceFilter: 10,
      url: 'http://my.server.com/locations',
      autoSync: true,
      stopOnTerminate: false,
      startOnBoot: true
    }, (state) => {
      console.log('[ready] BackgroundGeolocation is ready to use');
      if (!state.enabled) {
        // 3.  Start tracking.
        BackgroundGeolocation.start();
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### Cordova / Ionic 1

```javascript
// Like any Cordova plugin, you must wait for deviceready before referencing the plugin.
function onDeviceReady() {
  // 1.  Listen to events
  var bgGeo = window.BackgroundGeolocation;

  bgGeo.onLocation(function(location) {
    console.log('[location] -', location);
  });

  bgGeo.onMotionChange(function(event) {
    console.log('[motionchange] -', event.isMoving, event.location);
  });

  bgGeo.onHttp(function(response) {
    console.log('[http] - ', response.success, response.status, response.responseText);
  });

  bgGeo.onProviderChange(function(event) {
    console.log('[providerchange] -', event.status, event.enabled, event.gps, event.network);
  });

  // 2. Execute #ready method:
  bgGeo.ready({
    reset: true,
    debug: true,
    logLevel: bgGeo.LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE,
    desiredAccuracy: bgGeo.DESIRED_ACCURACY_HIGH,
    distanceFilter: 10,
    url: 'http://my.server.com/locations',
    autoSync: true,
    stopOnTerminate: false,
    startOnBoot: true
  }, function(state) {    // <-- Current state provided to #configure callback
    // 3.  Start tracking
    console.log('BackgroundGeolocation is configured and ready to use');
    if (!state.enabled) {
      bgGeo.start().then(function() {
        console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation tracking started');
      });
    }
  });

  // NOTE:  Do NOT execute any API methods which will access location-services
  // until the callback to #ready executes!
  //
  // For example, DO NOT do this here:
  //
  // bgGeo.getCurrentPosition();   // <-- NO!
  // bgGeo.start();                // <-- NO!
}
```


:information_source: **NOTE:** The configuration **`{}`** provided to the `#ready` method is applied **only** when your app is **first booted** &mdash; for every launch thereafter, the plugin will automatically load the last known configuration from persistant storage.  If you wish to **force** the `#ready` method to *always* apply the supplied config `{}`, you can specify **`reset: true`**

```javascript
BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
  reset: true,  // <-- true to always apply the supplied config
  distanceFilter: 10
}, function(state) {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation is ready: ', state);
});
```

:warning: Do not execute *any* API method which will require accessing location-services until the callback to **`#ready`** executes (eg: `#getCurrentPosition`, `#watchPosition`, `#start`).

### Promise API

The `BackgroundGeolocation` Javascript API supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for *nearly* every method (the exceptions are **`#watchPosition`** and adding event-listeners (eg: `#onLocation`).  For more information, see the [API Documentation](https://transistorsoft.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation-lt)

```javascript
// Traditional API still works:
BackgroundGeolocation.ready({desiredAccuracy: 0, distanceFilter: 50}).then(state => {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation is ready: ', state);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation error: ', error);
});
```


## :large_blue_diamond: [Advanced Sample Application](https://github.com/christocracy/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp)

A fully-featured [SampleApp](https://github.com/christocracy/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp) is available in its own public repo.  After first cloning that repo, follow the installation instructions in the **README** there.  This SampleApp includes a settings-screen allowing you to quickly experiment with all the different settings available for each platform.

If you're using XCode, boot the SampleApp in the iOS Simulator and enable ```Debug->Location->Freeway Drive```.
