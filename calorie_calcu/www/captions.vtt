00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.910
In a greenhouse nestled in a valley near
Half Moon Bay, California farmer Ken

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.370
Armstrong is tending to his herd. Some
3,000 fish who are key members of a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
complex ecosystem, that also includes
some helpful bacteria, and these floating

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.350
leafy greens. There's not a speck of soil
to be seen here at Ouroboros Farms where,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.769
Armstrong and his colleagues are growing produce with an agricultural system

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.029
called Aquaponics. The fish are the
integral part of the system, they provide

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.160
the nutrients for all, for the system. So
we feed our fish and organic fish feed,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.140
and this is becomes the nutrient base
for all of our plants. So the the food

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.219
that the fish eat becomes usable
nitrogen by the plants, and so the fish

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.760
are actually the engine, the growth, this
is where all the magic happens. In other

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
words, the fish waste becomes food for
the plants, and the plants in turn clean

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.480
the water for the fish. It's a delicately
balanced system that requires some basic

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.879
science to master. Armstrong isn't the
first farmer to try aquaponics, it's a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.320
method that's been around for a really
long time. It's believed the Aztecs and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
ancient cultures and parts of Asia
fertilize their crops with wild fish.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.920
Today aquaponics is being used in a
number of countries from Myanmar, to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.890
Peru, to Germany, even on rooftops in Gaza.
In the U.S. a small number of backyard

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
hobbyists have been tinkering with the
system for years, but until recently it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
hasn't been tried on a large scale,
commercial basis. Now, the team at

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.110
Ouroboros Farms and a handful of other
operations around the country are giving

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.200
it a go. Plants here grow about 1/3
faster than if they were grown in soil.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.439
Faster plant growth is one of the
benefits of aquaponics, but the other big

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.090
one is water usage, a critical issue in
drought stricken California, where a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.690
large percentage of the state's
developed water goes to agriculture.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.490
Some in the aquaponics industry claim
their systems use about 90% less water

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.990
than traditional soil farming. There's
almost no evaporation in these systems,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.170
the only usage of water comes through
transpiration, what the plants actually

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.030
utilize. Comparing to soil agriculture
plants can only take up water through

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.260
the tips of their roots, so you need to
soak the top layer of soil in order for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.100
the water to get down to where the plant
can actually use it. So that that top

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.350
layer of topsoil, all that water just
evaporates. The 60,000 gallons of water

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.110
at Ouroboros have been circulating for a
year,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.580
weekly top offs are needed, but the
overall water savings for each plant

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.690
grown is significant. For example,
Armstrong says a mature head of lettuce

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.480
and his operation, uses about a gallon of
water over the six week growth cycle, far

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.110
less than most lettuces grown in soil. That is amazing. But for all its benefits,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.580
Aquaponics does have its limitations. It
doesn't make sense economically to grow

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.260
certain staple foods like wheat and corn
given the infrastructure of the system.
